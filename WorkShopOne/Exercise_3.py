# This fiel is all about printing to the command line
# This is really important when it comes to building our text based games 
# It is also important in broader programming so is useful to fully understand

# In python we print using the print() method
print("Hello World")


# We can print variables inside these statements

#Write your name here
my_name = 

print('Hellow my name is '+my_name)

#We can also format our outputs by putting f at the front of the print
a = 10
b = 10

# what will this print?
print("The answer is "+str(a)+str(b))

# what will this print? 
print(f'The answer is {a+b}')
