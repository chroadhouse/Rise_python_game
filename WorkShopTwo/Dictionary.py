# This is all about dictionaries

# This is how we create a dictionary
my_dict = {}

# We can use dictionaries when we want to store data 
# Below is an example for an animal

dog_file = {'Animal Type':'Dog',
              'Name':'Percy',
              'Breed':'Dashound',
              'Age':10,
              'Sex':'M'
              }

name = dog_file['Name']

# Now try make your own animal file using a dictionary
